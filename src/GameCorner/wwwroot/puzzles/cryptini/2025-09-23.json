  "clue": "Illicit port? Sore head, peaky, about seasick...",
  "enumeration": "9",
  "answer": "SPEAKEASY",
  "explanation": "\"Sea sick\" tells us to anagram SEA (make it sick). We put PEAKY around (about) the anagram of SEA to create PEAK+EAS+Y. Sore head (S) + PEAKEASY = SPEAKEASY. Since a port is a harbour or shelter, a speakeasy is an illicit port!"
