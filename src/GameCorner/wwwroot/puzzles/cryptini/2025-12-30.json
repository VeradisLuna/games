  "clue": "Side note - change hang-out time",
  "enumeration": "6",
  "answer": "FACET",
  "explanation": "Tricky one! CHANGE with HANG out is CE. Time is T. A two-letter note could be FA. FA+CE+T = FACET, meaning \"side\".",
  "hints": [
    "Time can be replaced with a T.",
    "\"-out\" is being used as a deletion indicator.",
    "What letters can we get from \"change hang-out\"?",
    "\"Note\" often refers to a musical note. This could be A through G, or it could be solfège. (Do Re Mi etc...)",
    "The definition is \"side\", as in a plane (perhaps of something that has many sides)."
