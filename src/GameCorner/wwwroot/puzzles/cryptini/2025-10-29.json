  "clue": "\"Square R1 Left L1 Circle\" initially nets very large amount",
  "enumeration": "8",
  "answer": "TRILLION",
  "explanation": "It may look a bit like a cheat code, but there's a bit more going on here... In cryptic crosswordese, \"square\" often implies T (as in T-square). Then we've got RI (R1), L (Left), LI (L1), O (Circle), and N (initially NETS). All in all we've got TRILLION, a very large amount."
