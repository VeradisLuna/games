  "enumeration": "9",
  "answer": "CHARACTER",
  "explanation": "\"Dream\" is a loose anagram indicator for CATCHER - if something is in a dream, or dreamy, it's not quite as in reality. \"Only every other\" DREAM is RA. The CATCHER anagram \"captures\" RA to give CHARACTER, meaning \"feeling\".",

    "\"Captures\" tells us to put one part of the wordplay inside another.",
    "We need to take \"only every other\" in DREAM.",
    "The first \"dream\" is a loose anagram indicator for one of the words. If something is in a dream, it's not quite as it would be in reality.",
    "The definition is \"feeling\"."
