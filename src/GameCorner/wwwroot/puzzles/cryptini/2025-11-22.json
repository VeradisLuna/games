  "clue": "Gathering of four outspoken, then unsure",
  "enumeration": "5",
  "answer": "FORUM",
  "explanation": "\"Outspoken\" is a homophone indicator - we want a word that sounds like four. \"Unsure\" (hesitant, etc.), is a fairly standard way of indicating UM. FOR + UM = FORUM, or gathering.",
  "hints": [
    "The definition is \"gathering\".",
    "\"Outspoken\" tells us to say one of the words out loud - we're looking for a word that sounds the same.",
    "What filler word might you use if you're unsure?"
