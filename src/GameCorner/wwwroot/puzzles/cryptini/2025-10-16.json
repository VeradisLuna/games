  "clue": "Turner portrait defaced by mistake?",
  "enumeration": "7",
  "answer": "TRAITOR",
  "explanation": "PORTRAIT \"defaced\" gives ORTRAIT, which \"by mistake\" can be anagrammed to TRAITOR. A traitor is a \"turner\" - somebody who turns. The definition is a little loose, but this is flagged by the clue's question mark."
